ShareSoap
=========

ShareSoap is a PHP class to access and modify Sharepoint content via its web interfaces (SOAP etc.). It's able to authenticate using the default NTLM authentication used in Sharepoint. 

The code has been combined and slightly modifies from various other PHP/Sharepoint projects. The development is still in it's early stages so major changes can be expected.
Also any help would be appreciated.
